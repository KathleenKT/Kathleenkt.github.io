BIOGRAPHY

I discovered I wanted to go into psychology when I decided to quit natural sciences and enrolled in a technical degree. Upon graduating from this degree, I was employed in social services in the youth protection centers as an educator. Here is where I obtain all my field work experience that keeps me inspired for my research. 

I graduated from the [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/psychology.html?utm_source=vanity&utm_campaign=psychology) with a BA in psychology in 2014. In 2015, I started my MA in psychology in the research option. During this year, I prepared an interim research report examining longitudinal predictors of criminal offending. I then accelerated to the PhD program in 2016, where I continued my work with predicting criminal offending, using mediation based on counterfactuals. I expect to graduate by the end of 2020.

Currently I investigate questions related to the development of criminality through my work as a PhD Candidate at [CRDH Concordia University](http://crdh.concordia.ca/homee.html) in the department of Psychology. 

Other research interests include the application of evolutionary theory to developmental models, the biological basis of mental health disorders, and the development of mental health disorders. I am also interested in advanced statistical modelling including mediation based on counterfactuals.
