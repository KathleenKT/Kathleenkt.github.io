Hello, World!

![](WABFpresentation.jpg)

I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to breast cancer through my work as a Research Biostatistician at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) in the department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics.
